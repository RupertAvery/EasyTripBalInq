EasyTrip Balance Inquiry source code

This source code was decompiled from the Mono C# libraries extracted from the EasyTrip Balance Inquiry Android APK.  

This posts HTTP requests to the easytrip servers (hardcoded URL) using an encryption mechanism, and decrypts the returned response.
he passphrases used for encryption/decryption were hardcoded in the assembly.

The EasyTrip Android UI is horrible, hopefully someone can use this to create a better version.
